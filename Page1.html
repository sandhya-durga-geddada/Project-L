                    A.V.V. Manikanata Sai, born on June 7, 2005, is 19 years old. He is one of the purest souls I love the most, and he is absolutely perfect just the way he is. He‚Äôs smart, gentle, and one of the calmest people I know. In almost every situation, he remains cool and composed‚Äîexcept when I create any thala thikka pani, which brings out a different side of him. But I love that side of him too. He is tough as Quantum Physics.So.. tough. The more sincere and dedicated he is, the more intense his emotions can be, but that‚Äôs what makes him so real and admirable. I love him so much!

            <h3>Hey..‚ù§<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saying all these things might seem a little cringey, but I still want to say them, so please don‚Äôt feel awkward about it. Just imagine sometime that we‚Äôre in a 'nibba and nibbi' world.<br> For the past year, I‚Äôve become so habituated to you.I love to spend time with you , even if it's just a little time.I always want to spend more with you. I enjoy feeling your presence wherever I go. I love talking to you. I love walking with you.I love doing anything with you.& What I love most about us is holding hands.
            As for my feelings towards you, I don't exactly know why or when I started loving you, but I can say that no matter what happens between us, my love for you will never fade. I Love the times we spend together in this one year.
            In this past year, I‚Äôve learned so many things from you, and I've realized a lot. I didn‚Äôt know these things before, and I didn‚Äôt know how to behave when I‚Äôm in a relationship. I know these things have hurt you, and I‚Äôm very sorry for that & Thank you so muchüòò.<br>I always think that you deserve so much more than this, so I will always try my best to give you the love you deserve.
            I'm not the best at expressing myself. I always try to say something that sounds good to hear, but I don't have the right words to express my feelings. My words may end here, but my love for you never will.<br>I love you so much, Mr. Venu ‚ù§ ."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-- Sanju‚ò∫Ô∏è
